# Minimal API Demo

A beginner-friendly ASP.NET Core Minimal API project to practice clean architecture, monorepo structuring, and modern development workflows — with guidance and mentorship from [Craig McLellen](https://github.com/cmclellen).
I'm deeply grateful for his time, insight, and ongoing support throughout this journey.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a foundational backend component for future expansion into a monorepo structure including:

- API
- UI (planned)
- Infrastructure scripts (planned)
- Testing (planned)

The API was scaffolded with a focus on simplicity to build understanding before introducing additional layers like CI/CD and authentication.
